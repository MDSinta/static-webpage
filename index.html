                Unité d'Habitation of Berlin (The name given by Le Corbusier is Unité d'habitation "Typ Berlin") is a 1958 apartment building located in Berlin-Westend (borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf), Germany, designed by Le Corbusier following his concept of Unité d'Habitation.[1] Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation concept was materialised in four other buildings in France with a similar design. The building is constructed in béton brut (rough-cast concrete) and is part of the initial architecture style we know today as brutalism. The structure was built with on site prefab cast concrete panels and poured ceiling slabs. The Modulor system is the base measure of the Unité and Corbusier used not more than 15 Modulor measures to construct the entire structure form. Ultimately the work has been eliminated from Le Corbusier's oeuvre,[2] which he confirmed[3][4] himself until his death in 1965 and which has also been confirmed posthumous in 1967 in his last authorized publication of his work.[5]
